How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

  Drew attention to the correct line.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

  Easily rollback changes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

  Pro - you know exactly when your previous versions happened so you know where to roll back to.
  Con - if you don't stay on it, you'll miss changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

  Google is document-level, Git can tie entire directories into a single version since files are connected.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

  git log shows commits with comments.  git diff shows differences between commits so you can see changes.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

  You can easily roll back changes to a stable version if things break.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

  All the things!
